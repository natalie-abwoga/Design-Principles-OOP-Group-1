This repository is a collection of examples demonstrating the SOLID principles in object-oriented design
What are SOLID Design Principles?
SOLID is an acronym for five design principles in object-oriented programming that help make software more understandable, flexible, and maintainable:

S – Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should only have one job or responsibility.

O – Open/Closed Principle (OCP): Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification.

L – Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without affecting the correctness of the program.

I – Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use. Use smaller, specific interfaces rather than a large general-purpose one.

D – Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions.
